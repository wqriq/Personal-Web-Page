        <p>I started my education at age 6, <br>
        going to the local school in my village.<br>
    I loved school, met new friends and <br>was excited to go there everyday.<br>
When i was 15 i started going<br> to the city's High School<br>
Where I was one of the best <br>students and had a lot of diplomas <br>
for all the competitions<br>
 that i was a part of.<br></p>
